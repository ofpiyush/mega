# Mega
Adds expensive post-rocket late-game researches to unlock express unloading, unlimited mining, oil production and large energy source.

To keep the game somewhat fair-ish, the items themselves are also extremely expensive, somewhere between half to same resources as it would take for equivalent setup.

We wanted to focus on the puzzle aspect of building a big base. Constantly building tons of mining outposts started getting boring real quick. Solar fields cover half the map and are also pretty boring at this point.

Infinity chests, pipes and electricity interface were too powerful and felt very cheat-ey, so we made limited variants for raw resources and added a ton of resource requirements to unlock and craft them.
